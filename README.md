This is a current web application I am developing which will let user order food and then will email them there order and total to the 
email they will enter and also add it to a online mongoDB that we can access to see al the orders customers made. After it is finished it
will be a SPA (Single page application) that uses Angular for front end,Express for backend and MongoDB for database.
